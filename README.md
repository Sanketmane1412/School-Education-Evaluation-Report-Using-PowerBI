# School-Education-Evaluation-Report-Using-PowerBI

This project aims to build an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze student performance and attendance across several schools and education boards. The dataset includes details about schools, classes, students, age, attendance, gender, board, city, and subject-wise scores. The main goal was to turn raw educational data into useful insights using data visualization.

I began by importing the dataset into Power BI and cleaning and transforming the data with Power Query. I created measures like average attendance, average age, subject-wise scores, final grades, and percentages to aid in the analysis. The dashboard offers a complete picture of educational performance with key indicators such as total schools, total students, total classes, and average attendance.

I used various visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, and slicers, to examine attendance by gender, board and city attendance, subject performance by class, and final grade distribution. Interactive filters let users explore data by school, class, board, city, and gender.

Through this project, I learned to design clear dashboards, apply DAX measures, and present data in a way that helps monitor academic performance and support decision-making. The skills I gained are applicable to real-world reporting and analytics.
